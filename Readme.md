# TodoApp - Full Stack Todo Application (Spring Boot & React)

## Project Information

This **TodoApp** is a full-stack application where both the **backend (Spring Boot)** and **frontend (React)** run within the same JAR file. The application is accessible directly via **http://localhost:8080**, and the React frontend is served by the Spring Boot backend.

 **Maven** is used for managing both backend and frontend builds. The Maven **frontend-maven-plugin** is configured to automatically handle the frontend build (using `npm run build`) during the Maven build process. This ensures that every time you run a Maven build (`mvn clean install`), it also triggers the frontend build process, making the latest frontend code ready to be served with the backend.

With this setup, there's no need to run the frontend and backend separately â€“ everything is packaged and runs seamlessly together in one application.

### Technologies and Tools Used:
#### Backend (Spring Boot):
- **Java 19**: For application development.
- **Spring Boot 3.2.5**: For fast and easy backend development.
- **JWT (JSON Web Token)**: Used for user authentication and authorization.
- **Access Token**: Used for short-term authorization.
- **Refresh Token**: Used to renew the access token.
- **Maven**: For project and dependency management.
- **Docker**: For containerizing the application and distribution.
- **Docker Compose**: To run the application with its dependencies.
- **JUnit 5 & Mockito**: For writing unit tests and mocking.
- **Swagger (OpenAPI)**: For API documentation.

#### Frontend (React):
- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **React** Bootstrap: For responsive, user-friendly UI components.
- **Axios**: For handling HTTP requests between React and the Spring Boot API.
- **JWT Handling**: For secure communication between frontend and backend.
## Setup and Run Instructions

Follow these steps to build and run the project successfully.

### 1. Build the Application

Clone the project and build it using Maven:
 
Clone the project repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cdilsiz5/TodoApp.git
``` 
Navigate to the TodoApp directory

```bash
cd TodoApp
```
 Build the project using Maven

```bash
mvn clean install
```
### 2. Run the Todo App Application with Maven

To run the Todo App , use the following command:

Run Todo App
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### 3. Run the Test Suite with Maven

To run the unit tests in the project, use the following command:

Run all unit tests
```bash
mvn test
```
### 4. Push Docker Image to Docker Hub
Log in to Docker Hub and push the image:

Log in to Docker Hub
```bash
docker login
```

### 5. Build Docker Image
To containerize the project using Docker, you can build a Docker image with the following command:

Build the Docker image
```bash
docker build -t cihandsz/todo-app:latest .
```
This will create a Docker image of your project locally.


Push the Docker image
```bash
docker push cihandsz/todo-app:latest
```         
After this step, your image will be available on Docker Hub.

### 6. Start the Docker Container
To run the Docker container for your application, use the following command:

 Run the Docker container
```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 cihandsz/todo-app:latest
```
This will start the application on port 8080.

### 7. Docker Compose Setup

Then, start the application and its dependencies using:
 
Navigate to the TodoApp directory
```bash
cd TodoApp
```
 Start the application with Docker Compose
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
This will build and start the application within a Docker container, and map it to port 8080 on your local machine.

### 8. Access the Application
Once the application is up and running, you can access it at:

http://localhost:8080
